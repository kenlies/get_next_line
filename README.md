# get_next_line

## My hive(42) school get_next_line project [BONUSES] <-- ez ._.

Yeah, we had to have dublicate files for the bonuses, thats stupid I know.

main.c has a main that operates as a tester function and reads from the two text files included.
Doesn't test for absurdly long lines, but I've run external testers, and it works; (limit 4069, is enough)

Pretty straight forward project, and I think you've seen similiar solutions elsewhere lol.
